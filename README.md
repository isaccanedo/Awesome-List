## :computer: Courses

One huge benefit of picking up any of the following courses is that they all include access to some sort of community, either through a Slack channel or Discord. So not only will you be able to ask for help, you'll also be able to connect with the instructor, help others, network, and share feedback.

Frontend

- 🌟 [CSS for JS developers](https://css-for-js.dev/) - Josh C. Comeau teaches you modern CSS and how to create accessible, animated, thoughtful front ends. By far the best online course design i've ever experienced. It took me 6 months of casual progress to complete, but it can be completed in around 30 hours (10 modules * 3 hours). I might even consider going through it again to pickup on lessons that I may have missed or forgotten.
- 🌟 [Design for Developers](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/design-for-developers/) - Sarah Drasner teaches you the foundations of design, color theory, patterns, typography, and more. This was a great introduction to design and I loved it.
- [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) - This course is the best i've seen if you're looking to learn about Three.js. Guided by Bruno Simmon's, this course offers 5 chapters / 39 lessons / 45 hours of video content (or a textual guide if you prefer). Even if you're not interested in game development this course should give you an edge that will allow you to sprinkle a little magic into the standard UI and give your next website a wow factor that makes it stand out.
- [Testing Javascript](https://testingjavascript.com/) - Kent C. Dodd's designed this. Kent teaches you how to write clean, efficient, elegant tests for your JavaScript applications. I haven't completed this course but i'm excited to start.
- [Epic React](https://epicreact.dev/) - Kent C. Dodds also created this React course that teaches best practices when developing build top tier web apps. I haven't completed this course but i'm excited to start.

### 🎨 Design Libraries

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - The best design library is your own. Having full flexibility to modify any presentation to your will is a difference maker.

### :jigsaw: Component Libraries

Although component libraries such as Material UI and Google Material Design are very convenient I try to steer clear of them. Component libraries are typically designed for a specific purpose or brand. When i've seen projects adopt these pre-designed components they eventually hit a wall where they can't get something to look exactly how they'd like and so they start to make compromises on their design. Teams usually fall into this trap because component libraries are battle tested, well documented and have a lot of examples. However you can get the best of both worlds here, by using unstyled component libraries that focus on great accessibility and performance.

- 🌟 [Radix Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/overview/introduction) - Similar to ReachUI, An open-source UI component library for building high-quality, accessible design systems and web apps.
- 🌟 [ReachUI](https://reach.tech/) - Provides unstyled base components that come with great accessibility and performance. All you have to do is style them to fit your design.

<!-- I do not recommend the following but I want to keep them in this document for tracking purposes:
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) - React components for faster and easier web development. Build your own design system, or start with Material Design.
- [Google Material Design](https://material.io/) - A design system build by and for Google.
